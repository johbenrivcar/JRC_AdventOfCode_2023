        I decided to build an "engineered" solution to the pipe maze, where all the different components of 
        the maze are implemented as classes, and where the objects - i.e. the tiles, pipes, corners etc - are 
        responsible for assembling themselves on the big field and finding out where the path is an what are the 
        inside and outside tiles.
